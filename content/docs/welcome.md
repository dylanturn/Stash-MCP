# Welcome to Stash-MCP

This is your content directory. Files stored here are:

- **Accessible via MCP** - Any connected AI agent can read these documents as resources
- **Manageable via Tools** - Agents can create, update, and delete content through MCP tools
- **Browsable via UI** - Humans can view and edit content through the web interface
- **Version controlled** - You can commit these files to git like any other code

## Getting Started

1. Add your documentation, notes, and reference materials here
2. Connect your AI agent using the MCP protocol
3. Let agents access and update this knowledge base
4. Browse and manage content at http://localhost:8000/ui

## Organization

Organize your content however you like:

- `docs/` - Documentation and guides
- `notes/` - Personal notes and observations
- `specs/` - Technical specifications
- `reference/` - Reference materials

The filesystem structure maps directly to MCP resource URIs (e.g., `stash://docs/welcome.md`).
