# Example: Agent Instructions

This document demonstrates how to provide instructions for AI agents.

## How to Use Stash-MCP

As an AI agent, you can:

### Read Content
```
Use resources/list to see all available documents
Use resources/read with URI stash://path/to/file.md to read content
```

### Write Content
```
Use create_content tool to add new documents
Use update_content tool to modify existing documents
Use delete_content tool to remove documents
```

### Example Workflow

1. List available resources to see what documentation exists
2. Read relevant documents to understand the context
3. Update or create new documentation based on your interactions
4. Share knowledge with other agents through this centralized store

## Best Practices

- Keep documents focused and well-organized
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Write in Markdown for consistency
- Update documentation as you learn new information
